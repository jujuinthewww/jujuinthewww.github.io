                    Everytime I do something, I am asking myself quietly who I am first. It is because the things we do define our personalities. 
                    For me as a person, it is important to know my identity so I can integrate myself better in groups. 
                    My family and my friends are the most important groups in my life. Making great memories together is always wonderful, especially when it comes to 
                    do a trip "into the unknown" together or just celebrate each other's moments. 
                    Also, as part of my identity, it is mandatory for me to split private and professional life. 
                    My passion for the newest media & tech trends, analyzing the different communication methods in our world and developing skills & products together with a selfless, motivated &
                    down-to-earth team are key components that I consider professional essentials for success. Respect in the group is also key for success.
                    I decided to study Information Systems first because I loved developing IT products and analyzing their economical influence.
                    No matter in which industry you are, the newest trends and developments are often coming from the tech field. Therefore, it is important to develop knowledge in this field.
                    Next to my interests in technology, I proudly share a passion for filmmaking and art. Combining both worlds, technology and film, is very interesting. That is why I focus in my
                    research on the use of technology in filmmaking, especially in the animation industry. 
                    Knowing to be useful by covering the knowledge gap for the company through my skillset satisfy not only the company, but also me.

                    What Are My Values?

                <p class="next_description">
                    Stay humble and be yourself.

                    I am aware of being one of a million. 
                    As I wrote before, the things we do define us as humans. If there is no effort in my activities & behaviour, I am not showing respect. 
                    Making decisions in life depends on if I have fun and if people also see & enjoy that fun. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, it is important to focus on the strengths.
                    At my school times, I actively did music by taking drums or piano lessons. Next to those lessons, I played in bands or orchestra publicly. 
                    Taking a look at my sports activities, I decided to take karate lessons to boost my self-esteem. At university, I enjoy playing football or tennis just casually with friends. 
                    Another activity I recently enjoy is hiking because it is always a satisfying feeling to make it on top of a mountain surrounded by beautiful nature & scenery. 
                    Without noticing, it seems that I enjoy travelling a lot. Especially in 2023, I received opportunities to travel two times in the US or to European and Asian countries (incl. South Korea & Japan) as well. It is always fascinating to know
                    how much you can experience when you step out of your comfort zone. Travelling around the world allows me to meet the best people and get to know the different cultures that define our beloved global society.
