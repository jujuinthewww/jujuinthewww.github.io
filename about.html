                    Everytime I do something, I am asking myself quietly who I am. It is because the things we do define our personalities. 
                    For me as a person, it is important to know my identity so I can integrate myself better in groups. 
                    My family and my friends are the most important groups in my life. Making great memories together is always wonderful, especially when it comes to 
                    do a trip "into the unknown" together or just celebrate each other's being. 
                    Also, as part of my identity, it is mandatory for me to split private and professional life. 
                    My passion for the newest tech & media trends, analyzing the different communication methods in our universe and developing skills & products together with a selfless, motivated &
                    down-to-earth team are key components that I consider professional essentials for success.
                    I decided to study Information Systems because I love creating IT products or systems and analyzing their economical influence.
                    No matter in which industry you are, the newest trends and developments are often coming from the tech field. Therefore, it is important to develop knowledge in this field. 
                    Knowing to be useful by covering the knowledge gap for the company through my skillset satisfy not only the company, but also me.

                <p class="next_description">
                    Stay kind and be yourself.

                    I am aware of being one of a million. 
                    As I wrote before, the things we do define us as humans. If there is no effort in my activities & behaviour, what should people thinking of who I am. 
                    Making decisions in life depends on if I have fun and if people also enjoy it. 
                    At my school times, I actively did music by taking drums or piano lessons. Next to those lessons, I played in bands or orchestra publicly. 
                    Taking a look at my sports activities, I decided to take karate lessons so I can develop my personality to take more responsibilites. At university, I enjoy playing football or tennis just casually with friends. 
                    Another activity I recently enjoy is hiking because it is always a satisfying feeling to make it on top of a mountain surrounded by beautiful nature & scenery. 
                    Without noticing, it seems that I enjoy travelling a lot. Especially in 2023, I received opportunities to travel two times in the US, to some European and Asian countries (incl. South Korea & Japan). It is always fascinating to know
                    how much you can experience when you always step out of your comfort zone. Travelling around the world allows me to meet the best people and get to know the different cultures that define our beloved global society.
