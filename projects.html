                            <a href="https://sozialkompass.info/"> Sozialkompass</a> (engl.: Social Compass) was founded during a seminar led by the Chair of Information Systems in Muenster where we also participated in a hackathon called "msHack" in 2022.
                            During the hackathon, we won two prices: "Mentors Choice Award" & "2nd place". As a team of 10 students, we have worked on a digital & barrier-free solution to redesign the process 
                            of applying for social welfare benefits in Germany. In the seminar, I mainly supported the team in frontend development to create the website using JavaScript, React.js as framework and MongoDB for the data base. 
                            After the seminar, I mainly supported the team by contributing in project & stakeholder management. We documented our experience of the project seminar through a <a href="https://sozialkompass.uni-muenster.de"> Blog</a>.

                        Generative Art simply consists of automatic visuals created by running JavaScript code. Set rules, write code and bring it into motion. 
                        The result is kinda a digital artwork. Because I am interested in art & history during my free time, I wanted to combine my interests with my professional skills. 
                        Therefore, combining coding with art resulted into creating generative art that is part of my free time activites besides work (in other words: procastination project). 
                        You can see some of my generative art works on <a href="https://openprocessing.org/user/336828?view=sketches&o=5 "> Open Processing</a>, a website that allows the community of creative computer scientists to share their artwork publicly.

                    On June 2023, the Departmnent of Information Systems on the University of Muenster took 8 motivated students to the US for a Design Thinking seminar. This seminar was a cooperation with 
                    the University of West Georgia and Georgia State College & University, both colleges located near the city Atlanta. In the US, we received a Design Thinking case from the US company Southwire
                    which was about process optimization in "Order-to-Cash" and "Procure-to-Pay". Together with the US students, we presented our solutions for Southwire's case in one huge presentation meeting.
                    Not only allowed this seminar us to work in an international team, but it also gave us the best unforgettable US experience (such as enjoying the lake during sunset or experiencing US barbecue) we could ever make in our lives.

                I received the opportunity to become part of the National Model United Nation (NMUN) Delegation 2022/23 representing the University of Muenster.
                The intention behind the project is to take part in international simulated conferences that are hold on-site at UN headquarters such as in New York, Brussels or Bonn. To prepare for the
                conferences, we organized workshops to understand the concepts & structures of the UN, the nation's backgrounds and political debates. 
                It is a good opportunity to develop skills in diplomacy, negotiations, compromises, public speaking, economics, writing & research. Next to the conference participations, 
                there are internal organizational tasks in the delegation that must be executed such as fundraising, pr or coordination. I was part of the Fundraising Team which meant collecting
                money to make the participation of the conference affordable for everyone. We received support by several departments of the university and sold successfully waffles outside during the exam preparation phase. 
                Get a good impression on our NYC experience through the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nmun_muenster/?hl=de"> Instagram Channel</a> and meet the Delegation through this <a href="https://muenster-mun.de/nmun/blog2023"> Blog</a>.
