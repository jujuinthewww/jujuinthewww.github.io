                            <a href="https://sozialkompass.info/"> Sozialkompass</a> (engl.: Social Compass) was founded during a seminar led by the Chair of Information Systems in Muenster where we also participated in a hackathon called "msHack" in 2022.
                            During the hackathon, we won two prices: "Mentors Choice Award" & "2nd place". As a team of 10 students, we have worked on a digital & barrier-free solution to redesign the process 
                            of applying for social welfare benefits. In the seminar, I mainly supported the team in frontend development to create the website using JavaScript, React.js as framework and MongoDB for the data base. 
                            After the seminar, I mainly supported the team by contributing in project & stakeholder management. We documented our experience of the project seminar through a <a href="https://sozialkompass.uni-muenster.de"> Blog</a>.

                        Generative Art simply consists of automatic visuals created by running JavaScript code. Set rules, write code and bring it into motion. 
                        The result is kinda a digital artwork. Because I am interested in art & history during my free time, I wanted to combine my interests with my professional skiils. 
                        Therefore, combining coding with art resulted into creating generative art that is part of my free time activites besides work (so made just for fun). 
                        You can see some of my generative art works on <a href="https://openprocessing.org/user/336828?view=sketches&o=5 "> Open Processing</a>, a website that allows the community of creative computer scientists to share their artwork publicly.
