                         <h4> Berlin, Germany</h4>
                         <p> Deutsche Bahn offers startup programs with their startup division DB mindbox. During my internship at Deutsche Bahn, I became a member of the Startup Innovation Scouting Team.
                             Tasks included scouting, screening and selecting startups from all around the world. 
                             I learned hold several professional meetings with Startups to present them our startup programs or to check whether they could be a good fit for Deutsche Bahn.
                             Additionally to scouting tasks, we supported the program managers in preparing and co-organizing pitch events or workshops for Deutsche Bahn held in Berlin, Frankfurt or Munich HQs. 
                             Smaller tasks where I was involved included video editing or pre-developing new scounting processes and internal tools with Python, GPT4-API and Excel (VBA) that led to more automation of standardized tasks.

                            content pieces about stock markets, algo trading or process automatization. In addition to that, I directed & edited short videos for the startup
